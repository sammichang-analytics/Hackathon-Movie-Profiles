In this hackathon, we utilized the movielens database of movie reviews and ratings. 
I created radar chart graphs to visualize the favor tendencies of certain movie fans. First, only expert reviewers who were relatively balanced 
in the number of reviews that they gave each genre were used. From this, I grouped reviewers into genre fans and plotted the radar charts 
against the genre rating averages to visualize the other genres that these fans tend to favor or dislike.
